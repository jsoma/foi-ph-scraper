**Data from publicly available records from December 7, 2021 onwards**

# What is this?

This code scrapes and processes requests data from the Philippines' Freedom of Information website (www.foi.gov.ph). The goal is to create a single 
database of these requests in a data frame and make some analysis out of them such as:

Which agency received the most number of requests?

How many requests had been denied/approved?

What type of requests are most common?

# FOI background

Launched in 2016, the FOI website is in compliance with Executive Order No. 2, Series of 2016 by President Rodrigo Duterte that institutionalized 
freedom of information in the Executive branch of government.
